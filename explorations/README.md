# explorations

Contains all experimental work, from small tests to larger prototypes.

## Naming Conventions

- **Folders**: `dYYMMDD_descriptive_name` (e.g., `d250428_json_schema_to_baml_source_demo`)

  - Date prefix for chronological sorting
  - Underscores and character prefix for Python compatibility to enable easy imports between explorations when needed

- **Files**: `fNN_descriptive_name` (e.g., `f01_json_schema_to_baml_source_demo.py`)
  - Number prefix for sequential ordering
  - Each new file gets the next number in sequence (f01, f02, f03...)
  - This applies even to related files (e.g., `f02_solution.py` and `f03_solution.ipynb` which uses the python file)
  - Maintains clear chronology and potential dependency relationships
  - Underscores and character prefix for Python compatibility to enable easy imports between explorations when needed
