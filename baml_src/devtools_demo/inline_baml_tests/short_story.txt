**Title: The Data Whisperer**

Mira found the USB stick in a crack between the floorboards. Plugging it in, she found a single file named `message.json`. Her heart raced as she opened it:

#"
```json
{
  "from": "Unknown",
  "to": "Mira",
  "message": "The key is hidden in the lantern. Trust no one. \u2728"
}
```
"#

The lantern flickered in the corner of the room. She stood, whispering, "Game on."
